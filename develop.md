# Interligenter

## Server

### Validation
* maybe convert https://www.google.com/ to google.com?ðŸ¤”
* check if need Sanitization, validator.jsðŸ¤”


### Domain status
* when domain go to analysis he enter to data structure in the server and when the analysis finish he removed this why it's posible to check if the domain is onAnalysis
* what kind of data structure is prefer? array/json/redisðŸ¤”
* some times the domain is onAnalysis for update and the client can get result from db ðŸ¤”

### Functions in analysis
* i think that even if one source return error stil the other source can return data that can go to dbðŸ¤”
* do i need to enter to db only after geting response from both vt & whois or enter every response when it comesðŸ¤”
* requests to virustotal & whois need to be async
* get virustotal data & get whois data 
* check if domain onAnalysis

-------
## Database

### Functions for db
* insert domain
* check if domain exist
* update domain
* check if last update is more then month
### domains table

#### columns

* id ?
* domain - uniq q: google.com vs https://www.google.com/
* virustotal data
* whois data
* update time

-------
## Scheduler

option 1) do monthly update for all the records in db
\
option 2) do every night check for all the records and record that is month old do update
\
I guess option 2 is better

* find library node cron
* in production maybe not by node
